# God of War mini game

<h4 align="center"><i>Alpha v1.4 & a half</i></h4>

**_Organization:_**

This update was solely focused on organising the code into sperate .js files using ES modules so it can be easier to add updates and go through the code easily when checking for bugs. 
The code has also changed due to needing global variables and functions etc. Other than that, nothing much has changed other than the fact that the UI has gotten smaller now for some reason.

**_Small changes_**

- I changed the images for Olympus. I just realized after taking a look at the image again for "Olympus" from the previous updates, that the image was not actually an image of Mount Olympus. So I got correct and better 2 pictures to use for Olympus.
- Added images & code for Kratos to stand right and left after a battle if you still wanna move him around a little after a battle.
- Added a few other fixes and polishes 2.
